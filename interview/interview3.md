# Tell me about yourself

Well, I really thrive in high stress situations and I thoroughly enjoy developing and debugging software and web apps. I have had the privledge of leading 12 Team leads for a Cohort at Lambda School for roughly 3 months while I was a Section Lead. During that time I was also working full time as a Service Coordinator for Whayne Supply Company as well as going to school and furthering my knowledge, it has been an amazing experience, but I'm ready to spread my wings with a high-end company and really show off my skills.

# Model View Controller

The Model contains only the pure application data, it contains no logic describing how to present the data to a user.

The View presents the model’s data to the user. The view knows how to access the model’s data, but it does not know what this data means or what the user can do to manipulate it.

The Controller exists between the view and the model. It listens to events triggered by the view (or another external source) and executes the appropriate reaction to these events. In most cases, the reaction is to call a method on the model. Since the view and the model are connected through a notification mechanism, the result of this action is then automatically reflected in the view.
